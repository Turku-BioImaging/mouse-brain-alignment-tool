interactive_rois.py

known issue with transforming roi labels in napari

reduce point resolution of atlas rois

napari preferences, appearance was changed to increase the highlight thickness of shapes/points

possible to keep manually reshaped rois across the next image sets?

napari interface issues -- make "rois" layer automatically selected

excel file gets rewritten if napari is closed.

we need documentation!!!
